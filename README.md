# New Rust

## Thinking

1. Core Components
    1. Packet Capture - How will I collect network data? (e.g., use Rust crates like pnet or external tools like libpcap.)
    2. Threat Detection,
        1. Rule-based detection (e.g., suspicious IPs or patterns)?
        2. AI/ML-based anomaly detection (e.g., DDoS patterns)?
    3. Visualization/Reporting - How will you show results to users? (CLI, GUI, or dashboard?)
    4. Notification System - What kind of alerts? (e.g., emails, desktop notifications, Slack integrations.)
    5. Performance Considerations - How will you ensure it works well on both high- and low-bandwidth systems?
2. Goals
    1. MVP - a cli tool that monitors basic packet data and flags suspicious activity
    2. Long-term Vision - a desktop/web based dashboard
    3. Ideas,
        1. Packet Capture,
            1. Protocol Decoding,
                1. Add decoding for more protocols beyond HTTP/S and DNS, such as FTP, SMTP, or SSH.
                2. Highlight suspicious payloads (e.g., encoded data in HTTP headers or commands in SSH traffic).
            2. Filter Traffic,
                1. Allow users to filter captured packets by source/destination IP, port, or protocol.
            3. Save Captures,
                1. Add functionality to save raw packet captures in .pcap format for further analysis with tools like Wireshark.
            4. Real-Time Processing,
                1. Enable streaming capture and analysis for real-time threat detection.
        2. Basic Threat Detection
            1. Enhanced Rule-Based Detection,
                1. Use community-maintained blocklists for known malicious IPs or domains (e.g., AbuseIPDB, Threat Intelligence feeds).
                2. Add rules for specific attack patterns, such as SQL injection attempts in HTTP traffic.
            2. Anomaly Detection,
                1. Incorporate simple anomaly detection based on traffic patterns, e.g.,
                    1. Large bursts of traffic.
                    2. Traffic to unusual ports for a given time of day.
            3. Detection Scoring,
                1. Assign a "threat score" to detected events based on severity (e.g., minor, medium, critical).
                2. Allow users to customize alert thresholds based on these scores.
            4. Pluggable Rules,
                1. Enable users to add custom detection rules via configuration files.
        3. Alerts

                1. Add support for multiple alert types,
                    1. Email notifications.
                    2. Push notifications (via services like Pushbullet or Pushover).
                    3. Integration with Slack or Discord.
            2. Customizable Alerts:
                1. Let users specify which threats trigger alerts (e.g., port scans but not DNS anomalies).
            3. Interactive Alerts:
                1. Provide suggestions for mitigation in the alert messages (e.g., "Block IP 192.168.1.100 using your firewall").
            4. Alert Aggregation:
                1. Group similar alerts to prevent spamming the user with repetitive notifications.
        4. Lightweight CLI
            1. Interactive Mode:
                - Add an interactive mode where users can run commands step-by-step, view live traffic, and inspect packet details.
            2. Profiles for Common Scenarios:
                1. Predefine CLI profiles for common use cases:
                2. Example: threat-monitor --profile "home-wifi" for home network threats.
            3. Command Autocompletion:
                1. Implement shell autocompletion for commands and flags to enhance usability.

                2. Text files for terminal output.
                3. JSON for machine-readability and integration with external tools.
                4. HTML for visually appealing, shareable reports.
            2. Aggregated Statistics:
                1. Include summary statistics in the report:
                    1. Total packets analyzed.
                    2. Number of threats detected by category.
                    3. Geographic information for source IPs (using GeoIP databases).
            3. Periodic Reports:
                1. Schedule automatic generation of reports (e.g., daily or weekly).
                2. Example: threat-monitor --report --frequency daily
            4. Threat Visualizations:
                1. Incorporate basic visualizations using ASCII graphs in the CLI or export options for external tools (e.g., CSV/JSON for dashboards).
        6. Conversational AI,
            1. Can we integarte a sample AI chatbot that answers based on what data it has access to or can see?
